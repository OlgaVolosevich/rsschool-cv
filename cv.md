### Personal Information: 

I am a team player. In the process of developing the final group project for Andersen's courses I distributed tasks among the team, did code review, consulted and helped other team members, presented our project to the supervisors. 

I am not afraid of challenging tasks and can work on my own. In the period from 2013 to 2015, I took part in such sporting events as the World Championship in kayaking and canoeing, the World Championship in biathlon and many others. During these events I worked as a volunteer interpreter, performed bilingual translation, worked as a team host, a member of the accreditation center and a coordinator of participating teams at the airport and hotels.

```javascript
function list(names) {
    let result = "";
    for(i=0; i < names.length; i++) {
        if (i < names.length-2) {
            result += names[i].name +", ";
        } 
        else if (i === names.length-2) {
        result += names[i].name + " & ";
